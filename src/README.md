TO DO LIST to fix:

- Improve software architecture of repo:
    1-Try to unify all the Trainer_seq_struct and Trainer classes into a single class
        - Try to make use of decorators to behavioral changes, so that, I can avoid to modify functions
    2- specify datatype of methods, i.e. method1(arg1: string=something, arg1: string=something, ..) and so on.
    3- Try to improve the embedding architecture to inplicit depends on baseEmbedding class
    4- Try to eliminate rubish bunch of notebooks generated on test folder.
