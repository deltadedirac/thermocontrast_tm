To bear in mind:
- global_loss_MSE: Assess all FLIP Meltome partition training set(Mix) vs all FLIP Meltome partition test set using single MSE loss
- global_loss_composed: Assess all FLIP Meltome partition training set(Mix) vs all FLIP Meltome partition test set using dual loss and two outputs MLP (OGTpred, deltaTmpred)
- global_loss_MSE: Assess all FLIP Meltome partition training set(Mix) vs all FLIP Meltome partition test set using single MSE loss
